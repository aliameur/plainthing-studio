This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped
with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

# Plain Thing - A Next.js Project

## Overview

This project is a fully-realized web implementation of a designer's vision from Herdetya Priambodo on Dribbble. It's
designed to be visually striking and animation-heavy, featuring elements like infinite
carousels, on-scroll animations, and parallax & horizontal scrolling effects. This site was built using Next.js and
Framer Motion to demonstrate that even the most intricate and dynamic designs can be brought to life on the web.

## Target Audience

This project is intended to serve as a portfolio piece for me as a Frontend Developer. It's also an invitation to
designers who are looking to collaborate on creating web experiences without limitations.
